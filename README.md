# gpu_accelsearch
GPU-based Fourier Domain acceleration searching

This has been optimized for NVIDIA Kepler architecture. Might need additional tweaking for newer architectures.

The Fourier-Domain acceleration search technique that PRESTO uses in the routine accelsearch is described in http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AJ....124.1788R
